libcryptobox

CryptoBox is a project underway to develop a package that provides core
functions for safely employing cryptography, while using FIPS ciphers as
the underlying cryptographic primitives. It is heavily inspired by NaCL
The aim is provide developers with a well-documented, properly-written,
FIPS-compliant set of tools for proper encryption. Most developers will
want to use NaCL, but this is provided for scenarios in which the use
of Suite B ciphers might be required.
